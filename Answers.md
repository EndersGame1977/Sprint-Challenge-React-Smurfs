1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

        Server-side 
            Pros: Better at SEO than client-side
            Cons: Reloads entire page for each change.
        Client-side
            Pros: Only specific parts of a page get re-rendered
            Cons: Initial load takes longer because it's loading the entire website.
        Best practice is to use a server-side landing page for SEO and client-side for the rest of the website.
